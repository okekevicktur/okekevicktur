### 👋 Hey there! I’m Victor Okeke – But You Can Call Me **TechProvee** 🖥️🚀

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I’m **Victor Okeke**, but my friends in the tech world know me as **TechProvee** – the guy who loves crafting seamless user experiences and writing clean, efficient code. I specialize in making the web look beautiful and perform like a well-oiled machine.

### 🚀 What I Do

- **Crafting Web Magic**: Whether it's building stylish interfaces or creating responsive layouts, I bring ideas to life with **HTML, CSS, and TailwindCSS**.
- **JavaScript Ninja**: I'm fluent in **JavaScript** and love the added elegance of **TypeScript** for scaling projects.
- **React/Next.js Enthusiast**: React makes me smile, and **Next.js** takes it to the next level! I’m all about building fast, dynamic web apps that users (and search engines) love.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (I sprinkle in TypeScript when I want to make my code future-proof!).
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: React, Next.js, Typescript and TailwindCSS – because what's better than fast, clean code and sleek design?
- **Tools**: VS Code (I’ve got all the plugins), Git (because every masterpiece needs version control), and Figma (where I turn design dreams into reality).

### 🌱 What I’m Learning

I’m always on the lookout for the next big thing in frontend development. Right now, I’m diving deeper into:

- **Web Performance**: Making sure my web apps aren’t just beautiful but lightning fast.
- **Advanced React Patterns**: Constantly refining my knowledge of hooks, state management, and component optimization.

### 😎 Fun Facts About Me

- **CSS & I have a love-hate relationship**. Some days I feel like a CSS wizard; other days, centering a div is my Everest. But hey, who doesn’t love a good challenge?
- I’m constantly googling _“how to fix optimize performance”_. StackOverflow is basically my second home.
- I believe that **dark mode** is more than a trend; it's a lifestyle choice. 🌑
- When I’m not coding, I’m probably learning about the latest web trends or perfecting my playlist for the ultimate coding session.
