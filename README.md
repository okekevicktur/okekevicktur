### ⚡ Fun Bits

- **Dark mode is non-negotiable** 🌑 – my IDE, my browser, my life.
- **CSS is still my frenemy** – some days I'm a wizard, other days I'm Googling "how to center a div" for the 500th time.
- When I'm not coding, I'm curating the perfect coding playlist or diving into AI research papers.
